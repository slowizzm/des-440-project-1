Project 1: Narrative in Web Design
Exploration of the one-page, long scrolling format

Points: 100

For this project you will develop a one-page website “from concept to code”. We will be exploring the concept of narrative in web design. One page sites are rather good for this type of content. As opposed to a site where the user skips around at will, the one-page, long-scrolling format works well for content with a beginning, middle, and end.
